A simple and clean Jekyll theme that's easy to modify and very modular in component
and element reuse. The theme works well on mobile devices as well, using bootstrap
for much of the heavy lifting.

This theme uses Disqus for comments and includes Google Analytics support (both are
disabled out of the box).

Check out the demo - that's the live github branch and exactly what you'll get when
you clone it.

Enjoy!
