I am not a designer so I cannot impress you with breathtaking Jekyll themes, but brume is something that just came to my mind and I had to build it.

## Usage

- Download the ZIP file and extract it's contents.
- Open *_config.yml* file and enter your site's URL and add additional configuration or update the existing one if needed.
- Open *_data/brume.yml* file and fill in values for site name (site title), author (your name) and description (blog description). This file contains all the custom information about your page. You can access it using `site.data.brume` object.
- Open *about/index.md* file and add information about you or your site. You can delete this file and directory if not needed.
- Open *_data/links.yml* and add additional links or update the existing ones that you want to be displayed in the navigation menu.
- If you don't want to use CC BY-NC 4.0 licence for the content then you should change the footer text, which is located in *_layouts/default.html*.
- Change the logo, which can be found in *public/images* folder.
- Build your site and be happy!
