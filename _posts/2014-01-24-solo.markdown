[Solo](http://chibicode.github.io/solo) is a Jekyll theme that supports **single-page websites** only, but supports them well. Yes, it's responsive.

Solo is useful if...

* You want to create an "about me" page from a single markdown file and host it under a custom domain name.
* You want to create a single-page website that's mostly text, like [Know Your Company](https://knowyourcompany.com/).
* You want to share a single markdown file and tried GitHub Gist ([example](https://gist.github.com/dypsilon/5819504)), but would like something nicer-looking.
* You want something like GitHub's [automatic page generator](http://pages.github.com/) for a non-code repository.
